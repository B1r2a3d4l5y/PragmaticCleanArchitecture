# Code of Conduct

To clarify expected behavior in our community, we have adopted the **Contributor Covenant**. This Code of Conduct, used by many open-source communities, reflects our values well. You can learn more about the Contributor Covenant at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), and view other projects that have adopted it at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/).

## Our Promise

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make our community welcoming and harassment-free for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender, experience, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and communicate in ways that help create an open, friendly, and respectful community.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behavior include:

- Showing kindness and empathy
- Respecting different opinions and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on the community’s best interests

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Sexual language or advances
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Sharing others’ private information without permission
- Other behavior that is inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities of Leaders

Community leaders are responsible for enforcing these standards and may take fair action in response to inappropriate behavior. Leaders may remove comments, commits, code, or other contributions that do not follow this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces and when representing the community publicly (e.g., official emails or social media).

## Reporting

To report unacceptable behavior, contact community leaders at [YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]. All complaints will be reviewed fairly and promptly. Leaders will respect the privacy of reporters.

## Guidelines for Consequences

1. **Correction**: Private warning for inappropriate language or behavior.
2. **Warning**: Stronger warning for ongoing issues, with no contact allowed for a set period.
3. **Temporary Ban**: Ban from public communication in the community for serious or repeated problems.
4. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal for repeated or severe violations.

## Attribution
